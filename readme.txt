Plugin to encode/decode and display content using the ROT13 cipher.

== Description ==

The ROT13 Encoder/Decoder plugin allows bloggers and commenters to "encrypt" parts of their writing output with the [ROT13 cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) in order to conceal content from other readers who don't wish to read them.

Some cases where you or your site users may want to ROT13 content:

* Spoilers on a fan website when some visitors may not have caught up to the book/movie/TV episode being discussed.
* Discussing sensitive topics where a trigger warning may be required.

ROT13 Encoder/Decoder Features:

* Allow readers to decode by single- or double-clicking the ROT13'd text.
* Decoded content can be displayed inline or a tooltip-style popup.
* Visitors can also use ROT13 in their comments: e.g.  `[rot13]Spoilerific content example[/rot13]`
* Site admins can ROT13 entire comments in one click (Useful for comments that may violate community rules, but you don't necessarily want to delete).

A TinyMCE menu button is added to the editor to help bloggers select text in their posts to ROT13.  

== Installation ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Hopefully everything here is straightforward, but if not, post in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/rot13-encoderdecoder">support forum</a> and I'll see what I can do.

== Screenshots ==

1. Settings screen for the plugin. Here, the settings show that ROT13'd content will be decoded in place when the user single-clicks on it, and visitors can use the `[rot13]` shortcode in their comments.
2. Blog post with some ROT13'd content decrypted in a pop-up. 
3. Editor screen. Use <code>[rot13]</code> and <code>[/rot13]</code> to enclose the content to be ROT13'd, or select your text and click the ROT13 Encoder button. 
4. If activated, visitors to your blog can also ROT13 their comments.
5. A comment with some ROT13'd content.
6. Comments screen when the ROT13 Encoder/Decoder plugin is enabled.

= 1.7.1 =
* Fixed a now-nonexistent reference to a JavaScript object (fixes JS error w/ the Wordpress editor)

* No more shilling on the Settings screen. Enjoy!
