Plugin to encode content using the ROT13 cipher. 

== Description ==

The Rot13 Encoder/Decoder plugin allows bloggers and commenters to "encrypt" parts of their writing output with the [ROT13 cipher][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13] in order to conceal media-related spoilers, punchlines, solutions, or sensitive topics from other readers who don't wish to read them.

* Allow readers to decode by single- or double-clicking the ROT13'd text
* Decodes either inline or a tooltip-style popup.

A TinyMCE button is included to help bloggers select text in their posts to ROT13.  Commenters can use a BBCode-style tag (i.e., Wordpress shortcode) in their comments: e.g.  `[rot13]Spoilerific content example[/rot13]`
